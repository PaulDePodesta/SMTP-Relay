# Docker Compose file for the Postfix SMTP relay.  Values for most
# configuration settings are pulled from the accompanying .env file.
# Using a compose file makes it easy to deploy the relay on a VPS
# with a static IP: once DNS (including reverse DNS) points at the
# VPS you simply run `docker compose up -d` to start relaying mail
# from your dynamic environment.
